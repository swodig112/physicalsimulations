* Wavefronts
This project is named wavefronts because it was originally meant to render wavefronts only. But it's progressed to simulate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect][The Doppler effect]].

~wavefront1.py~ and ~wavefront2b.py~ work. ~wavefront2a.py~ doesn't work but I'll leave it here so everyone can take a look. The following gifs are example outputs.
